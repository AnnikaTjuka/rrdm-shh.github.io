# Capstone project

We will simulate what could be the likely scenario of a research project with different collaborators working on their own git repositories, and making pull request to the main project's repository.

For this project, you will be divided into groups of three. Each member of the group will get a different Github repository (capstone-A, capstone-B, capstone-C) representing each collaborator's work.

The goal will be to make Pull Requests to the main project's repository.
You will have to think about :
- the organisation of the project (think about a project structure like in [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools), or [here](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=652220&p=4575532))
- the runtime reproducibility (conda environment)
- dealing with merge conflicts ([on Github](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts), or [using a text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol))
- open issues to raise the problems and solve them with pull requests.

!>For the sake of this project, you will only be allowed to make pull request to the main project's repository. You can not send files or text directly to your colleagues.
