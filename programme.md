# Programme

## 29/01

### Morning

- Presentation from each department
    - What do the data look like
    - Archiving platform
- Jena Data Management platform
    - FAIR principles
    - Zenodo, Figshare and data/software archiving.
    - National Forschung Data Infrastruktur (NFDI)


### Afternoon
- Parallel Session
    - **Command line & bash** -- TBD: We will learn the basics of working with
      terminals and command lines.
    - **Runtime reproducibility with Conda and Jupyter** -- Maxime Borry: We will learn to use the package and environment manager [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest) and use it in combination with the notebook system [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to create reproducible research notebooks.
- **Versioning with Git and Github** -- Christoph Rzymski: We will learn the
  basics of version control systems and how Git & GitHub help with structuring
  and managing projects.

## 30/01

### Morning

- Parallel Session
    - **Workflow management systems using Snakemake** -- Alexander HÃ¼bner: We will learn how to write reproducible workflows for processing data and data analyses using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that allow us to run our analyses in a resource-efficient way both on your local computer and the computing cluster.
    - **Advanced Git & Github practice** -- Christoph Rzymski: Hands-on Git &
      GitHub exercises.
    - **Lexibank workflow** -- Simon J. Greenhill: We will talk about what the
      Lexibank idea is and how to move from raw data to lexeme data in CLDF in a
      reproducible fashion.
    - **Orthography profiles** -- Tiago Tresoldi: We will talk about what
      orthography profiles are, how to build them, and how they can help with
      answering different research questions in linguistics.


### Afternoon 

- Parallel Session
    - **Research Compendia with R** -- Clemens Schmid: We will get to know the concept of a research compendium, which bundles code, text and data for a journal article. We will then use the R package [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) to create an own compendium and explore how it facilitates (reproducible) research. Along the way, we will touch on advanced topics such as Virtualization and Continuous integration that can help us to achieve full reproducibility.
    - **Capstone project** -- You will put into practice what you've learned in the last two days and work on a mock research project involving different data, tools, and collaborators.
    - **DLCE tools & toolchains** -- TBD: A tour of the DLCE's different tools
      and how they can help with data management.
    - **Reproducible linguistic data, building blocks** -- Christoph Rzymski: We
      will talk about the building blocks of CLDF and CLLD, namely SQL(ite),
      CSVW, and JSON-LD. This will help shape a better understanding of how to
      work with CLDF data.
