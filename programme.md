# Programme

## 29/01

### Morning

- Presentation from each department
    - What do the data look like
    - Archiving platform
- What's on in research data management? (Research Data Management Helpdesk, FSU Jena)
    - FAIR principles **and other policies**
    - Zenodo, Figshare and data/software **publishing**
    - Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI)


### Afternoon

- Parallel Session
    - Command line and Bash -- Thiseas Lamnidis
    - **Runtime reproducibility with Conda and Jupyter** -- Maxime Borry: We will learn to use the package and environment manager [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest) and use it in combination with the notebook system [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to create reproducible research notebooks.
- **Versioning with Git and GitHub** -- Christoph Rzymski: We will take a look at
  the version control system Git and how it can help to facilitate reproducible
  research. As a final step, we will see how the platform GitHub integrates with
  Git and its ideas.

## 30/01

### Morning

- Advanced Git/Github practice -- Clemens Schmid and Maxime Borry
- Parallel Session
    - Make/Snakemake -- Alexander Huebner
    - **Linguistic Reference catalogs & core DLCE tools** -- Tiago Tresoldi: We
      will learn about the three core linguistic catalogs used by the DLCE for
      reproducible data management and in fulfilment of the FAIR principle:
      Glottolog (for language varieties), Concepticon (for comparable semantic
      concepts), and CLTS (for phonological transcriptions). The catalogs will
      be presented along with their tools and websites, which will be used for
      the data curation exercises in the final session on Lexibank.

### Afternoon

- Parallel Session
    - **Reproducible data curation with CLDF and CSVW** -- Christoph Rzymski: We
      will talk about the building blocks of our Cross-Linguistic Data Formats
      (CLDF) and how they help to make linguistic research more FAIR.
    - **Research Compendia with R** -- Clemens Schmid: We will get to know the concept of a research compendium, which bundles code, text and data for a journal article. We will then use the R package [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) to create an own compendium and explore how it facilitates (reproducible) research. Along the way, we will touch on advanced topics such as Virtualization and Continuous integration that can help us to achieve full reproducibility.
    - **Hands-on Lexibank** -- Tiago Tresoldi, Simon Greenhill, Christoph Rzymski: We will
      apply the knowledge of the previous sessions to get a better understanding
      of the idea behind Lexibank and how to get data ready for Lexibank.
    - **Capstone project** -- You will put into practice what you've learned in the last two days and work on a mock research project involving different data, tools, and collaborators.
